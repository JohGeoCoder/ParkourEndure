			<div class="text-justify">
				<p>In a nutshell, parkour is a discipline of movement that focuses on self-improvement through creative use of the practitioner's surroundings.</p>
				<p>A practitioner of parkour is often referred to as a "traceur", a french term meaning...tracer. In this context, we mean a tracer of routes.</p>
				<p>There are a few main ideas that make parkour stand out from other physical disciplines and sports.</p>
				<ul class="plain">
					<li>
						<strong>Autonomy</strong> - A traceur has no adversary or opponent to focus on. The only tools you 
						need are the shirt on your back and a pair of shoes. The world is your playing field and your mind is your opponent. The discipline 
						of parkour can be practiced in a completely indivisualistic manner, but it doesn't have to be.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Core Values</strong> - Traditional sports end at the sound of a buzzer, a certain score is reached, or when the opponent taps out.
						In parkour, the game never ends. With even occasional training and dedication, parkour's Five Core Values become part of your everyday life. 
						<p><strong>Respect, Perseverance, Courage, Humility, Integrity</strong></p>
					</li>
				</ul>
